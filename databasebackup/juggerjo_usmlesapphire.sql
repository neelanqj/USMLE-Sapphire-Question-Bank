That is what the medical institution stand for. That is what it is supposed to be. But when the bow breaks, the cradle will fall ... and it has fallen... if it ever what what we thought it was. <br/><br/>Here are a few fun facts:<br/>Did you know that 3/4 doctors in America are white caucasian males (although females make up at least 41% of new medical school grads under 30 years old)?<br/>Did you know that the higher ranks in the medical field are dominated by white caucasian males? This includes surgery, consultancy, and directorship positions?<br/>Did you know that over 30% of people admitted into North American Medical Schools come from family\'s that earn over $200,000 yearly? They are in the top 5% of American earners!<br/>Did you know that ten years ago, it wasn\'t illegal for doctors to accept payments from pharmaceutical companies in order for them to prescribe their medications to paitents?<br/><br/>You hear how doctors are the cream of the crop. They are our society\'s leaders and the smartest of the smart. However, what are these \'leaders\' doing to fix the inherient problems in their system\'s setup? Are they so comfortable that they\'ll simply take their fat paychecks home and do nothing else?You rarely hear about the biases in the admissions process, the bribery, the corruption ... But we all know it is there. The medical field is a cash farm. Taking the Step 1, 2, and 3 will cost you at least $3000. The books you need will cost you at least $3000 a year. It isn\'t cheap ... you\'ll spend at least $200,000 paying for your medical education on top of any educational loans you had previously.But if you make it, and become a doctor in America, you will be in the top 10% of earners. You\'ll pay off your loan easily ... especially, if you come from a family that has over $200,000 in annual income.<br/><br/>So this garners the question, how can the majority of doctors relate to the common man, when they have a priviledged upbringing? How can they understand the hidden factors that contribute to the decline of health in our society, if they haven\'t experienced or lived in the midst of it? Can the doctors who make decisions about our health care laws really be trusted? Should they be brought out into the spotlight and confronted?<br/><br/>The reality of the situation is that addressing these issues can be a career ender for many potential doctors. Furthermore, the doctors who see these issues will be too comfortable to say anything. After all, why do more for others when you have enough? <br/><br/>So all you potential leaders ... start fighting.

(14, 'An Argument For Capping & Reducing Doctor Wages', 'society', '<p><br />Doctors all around the world are known for being paid well. The average wage of a doctor in Canada, is 5x that of the wage of the average middle class non-medical professional. Reference below:|</p><br /><p>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-has-more-doctors-making-more-money-than-ever/article14562208/</p><br /><p>In this article I will touch upon the following points:<br />1) How doctor\'s wages as a group drive up the cost of medical services, medical education and pharmaceuticals. <br />2) The inherent legal conflict of interests that exist in the medical industry.<br />3) How doctor\'s wages as a group drive up the cost of living/taxes for non-medical professionals.<br />4) How the people who entering the medical profession are not representative of the general population.<br />5) How money isn\'t going into patient services, rather, it is being drained into elite doctor\'s wallets.<br />6) How medical industry is straddling the supply of doctors to increase the demand of the doctors. <br />At the end of this email, I will suggest possible solutions to addressing these issues.</p><br /><p>What doctor\'s fail to realize is that their wage (as a group) is that the #1 cost driver of health service fees, pharm costs and medical education fees. This is because medical educators are doctors! If you increase the average wage of a working doctor, medical teachers and doctors working in big pharm will expect more money as well. In order to remain competitive, businesses give into doctor\'s demands. What incentive is there to work as a teacher or for big pharm if they can make more working in a hospital? Insurance companies will charge more, because they know doctor\'s services and what they earn is very high.</p><br /><p>The money that doesn\'t come from tax dollars will come from:<br />1) government<br />2) students<br />3) banks</p><br /><p>Summarizing the above point, increasing the average wage of doctors indirectly causes increases in:<br />1) Pharmaceutical prices<br />2) Medical education<br />3) Insurance companies <br />3) Any industry which employees a lot of doctors, has high service charges!</p><br /><p>The numbers show this.</p><br /><p>These days, if your parents are not doctors, trust fund babies, or company CEOs, the costs of medical school is unaffordable. This is showing itself in the types of people who are getting into medical school (articles linked below):<br />https://www.aamc.org/download/102338/data/aibvol8no1.pdf/<br />http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/26/opinions/potarazu-drug-price-hikes/<br />https://www.aamc.org/download/276596/data/thehighpriceofadreamjob.pdf/<br />http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/the-race-problem-in-medicine-race/383613/</p><br /><p>The cost of medication in the western world is almost triple of what it is in 3rd world countries (perhaps more). The government and pharmaceutical industry blames the increased costs on stricter controls, regulations, and overly processes that don\'t work. If you go to India, Thailand, or China the cost of surgery is a 3rd of what it costs in America. The argument in Canada is that we have the best doctors, and consequently, they deserve the best salaries. However, the issue arises when this salary is overly inflated strategically.</p><br /><p>Since the number of medical training positions and university training spots is straddled, the supply cannot meet the demand, and consequently, the doctors use this bargaining power to inflate their wages to unnatural amounts. The system as it is, is rigged to cause a shortage of doctors. Reference below:</p><br /><p>http://www.pemfellows.com/blog/the-reasons-why-it-is-difficult-to-match-a-closer-look-at-americas-medical-training-status/</p><br /><p>Another argument for increasing wages is that if the wages of doctors are not competitive on a country wide scale, other countries will take away our doctors. However, most trained doctors would choose to work close to home and their loved ones, rather than moving away. They are looking for security for their family, and better than average wages. I attended a medical school offshore, and this was the mentality of most of the students there. Dr Eric Hoskins also mentioned this argument in his speech the other day:</p><br /><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHN2gLeAEq0</p><br /><p>Furthermore, due to doctors coming from high earning families. The medical profession over time is creating a subgroup of people who don\'t truly get the needs of the average person. They understand in theory, but they don\'t really understand what it is like to come from poverty.</p><br /><p>The OMA as an organization is inherently flawed when a doctor that works for the regulatory board can quit, and go and work for a hospital, school or pharmaceutical company. It can be considered legalized corruption. Especially, since it is doctors setting the wage of other doctors! Many doctors on the regulatory committee have a vested interest in increasing other doctor\'s salaries disproportionally in preparation for when they quit or move to another position. Especially, since doctors reference other doctors. This is a conflict of interest.</p><br /><p>Below are some public disclosures of some hospital employee salaries:<br />http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/2012/hospit12d.html<br />https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/The-Ottawa-Hospital-Salaries-E116113.htm?&amp;countryRedirect=true<br />https://www.glassdoor.ca/Salary/Toronto-East-General-Hospital-Salaries-E452712.htm?&amp;countryRedirect=true</p><br /><p>Healthcare, is a huge consumer of tax dollars, although it doesn\'t produce goods and services that strengthen a countries economy. Furthermore, money from healthcare is being spent on temporary cures, rather than permanent ones (due to profit interests from big pharm)&gt; This causes the costs of healthcare to keep rising, and as a result gives doctors more work. Big pharm abusing its power in the name of profits is giving doctors more work and driving up medical care costs.</p><br /><p>Now, this is what happens in the long term when you increase the cost of service in one industry, the salaries in other industries will have to increase so that it\'s employees can afford services in that industry:</p><br /><p>The wage of the average worker will have to increase; Parents will need more money in order to afford medications and hospital will need more money to hire and train doctors. This in turn will increase taxes for the general population. The cycle will continue, doctors will never have enough when the money isn\'t evenly distributed, and big pharm keeps inflating prices to strategically take away money from service providers. Furthermore, new doctors will have to funnel a lot of their money into paying inflated loans caused by other doctors.</p><br /><p>Doctors don\'t need more money, their salary needs to be capped as a group. The cost of living has to be brought down, so that money has more value. If you increase senior doctor\'s wages, and the medical system will drive itself into collapse.</p><br /><p>Potential Solutions:<br />1) How doctor\'s wages as a group drive up the cost of medical services, medical education and pharmaceuticals. <br />Cap doctor\'s wages at $150,000. Invest the left over money in technology and services that will reduce the doctor\'s work load, health problems in the community and medical training costs. You have to address the issues before they become work. Examples are:<br />* Cheaper gyms (fit for less is a good start)<br />* Free fitness programs in the community<br />* Better health education<br />* Taxing of unhealthy foods (like you increased the tax on alcohol and cigarettes)<br />* Having printed on all foods and restaurants by law how much exercise you\'ll have to do if you eat it, in order to burn off the calories.<br />* Permanent cures, rather than temporary ones.<br />* Better computer aids for diagnosing patients (like WebMD). Make their use mandatory.<br />* A database with patient\'s conditions and history worldwide. This will result in instant identification of outbreaks, new diseases, poor medical practices, how many patients\' doctors are seeing, easier doctor analysis etc ... many people say that this is due to privacy issues. This is bull, if you have the right person talk to the right doctor, they\'ll give you the information about a patient. Technology is the future, and doctors are afraid of it, because it might reduce their workload. They prefer overcomplicated procedures, to make themselves seem smarter. In reality, a properly built computer can do many things the doctors do at a faster rate (even detect arrhythmias without the need for a doctor to listen to the patient\'s heart). <br />* Make the basic sciences and questions banks for studying them free and online. Make students learn this ahead of time as an entry criteria to Medical School in addition to the MCAT, then the teacher fees won\'t have to be paid, and you\'ll have an automatic initial screening of the students and their study practices. The government can subsidize this and students can come to a school for testing and lab work after they\'ve studied all their material. This will reduce doctor training fees.<br />* Better scheduling systems so that patients can know ahead of time, which hospitals/clinics are overloaded.<br />* Recruitment programs.</p><br /><p>2) The inherent legal conflict of interests that exist in the medical industry.<br />Revoke the licenses of people that join the OMA and people that set doctor salaries. Make it so that they can never practice as a doctor again, and have to work in another profession, for a set number of years prior to joining the OMA if they were a doctor. Or doctors who worked in non-profit settings for the majority of their life and clearly didn\'t abuse the system. Cap salaries of people in big pharm.</p><br /><p>3) How doctor\'s wages as a group drive up the cost of living/taxes for non-medical professionals.<br />Focus on reducing cost of living, rather than on increasing wages. Money is only as valuable as the goods and services in the area. Use this as the basis for setting hospital employee\'s salaries. Don\'t make it deviate from the average worker\'s salary by so much.</p><br /><p>4) How the people who entering the medical profession are not representative of the general population.<br />Get doctors from all demographics of life. Make it mandatory for medical students/professionals to volunteer and improve their community so they aren\'t detached form the issues of the regular person (help in homeless shelters, clean the roads, clean the washrooms in the schools, raise money for causes etc ...). Drop their salaries progressively if they don\'t. Let an external party handle this monitoring since medical professionals will cover for each other. Reduce the cost of medical school so that people that can\'t afford it, will be able to afford it.<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hospital-records-falsified-cover-medical-mistakes-article-1.395194</p><br /><p>5) How money isn\'t going into patient services, rather, it is being drained into elite doctor\'s wallets.<br />Cap their salaries, and make the money saved go into services. Of course, this will also make capping the salaries of executives of a company necessary as well. Lead by example. Don\'t abuse power. Invest in training programs (good ones). Keep statistics on them since not all training programs are created equally. Get rid of people who abuse the system. Fast track/specialize training doctors in order to meet the demands in particular specialties.</p><br /><p>6) How medical industry is straddling the supply of doctors to increase the demand of the doctors. <br />Use statistics and technology to monitor people and groups of people. Start filtering people for their character etc ... Revise the training programs to allow for faster doctors training and classify doctors by the amount of training they had and their skills via computers and rating systems. Technology is the future. Use it to the max.</p><br /><p>I hope this brought clarity to your situation.

Anti-La is found in 35% of people with SjÃ¶gren\'s syndrome. For this reason, their presence may be useful in diagnosing one of these disorders. Both antibodies are associated with neonatal lupus, a rare but potentially serious problem in newborns. In pregnant women, a positive Anti-Ro(SSA) or Anti-La(SSB) warns doctors of the need to monitor the unborn baby. Like other antibodies, the fact that the test is not positive in many people with lupus means it can\'t be used to diagnose lupus.

Potassium and sodium bicarbonate are excreted in the urine. This phase may last as long as 12 hours. <br/><br/> In phase 2, paradoxic aciduria in the presence of continued respiratory alkalosis occurs when sufficient potassium has been lost from the kidneys. This phase may begin within hours and may last 12-24 hours. <br/><br/> Phase 3 includes dehydration, hypokalemia, and progressive metabolic acidosis. This phase may begin 4-6 hours after ingestion in a young infant or 24 hours or more after ingestion in an adolescent or adult. <br/><br/> Nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and tinnitus[4] are the earliest signs and symptoms of salicylate toxicity.

Over the age of 70 the most likely cause is degenerative calcific aortic stenosis while under the age of 70 a bicuspid aortic valve is the likely culprit. Rheumatic heart disease is the third leading cause. Physical examination reveals a crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the aortic listening post (right upper sternal border) which radiates to the carotids. The more severe the aortic stenosis the later the peak of the murmur in systole and the softer the A2 component of the S2 heart sound.<br/><br/>â€œPulses parvus et tardusâ€ is present upon carotid artery examination. Remember parvus means weak and tardus means late. The murmur can radiate to the apex and sound holosystolic mimicking mitral regurgitation (this is known as the Galiverdin phenomenon). No medical treatment is available for aortic stenosis. Aortic valve replacement surgically is indicated for anyone who is symptomatic.<br/><br/>Aortic valve regurgitation (A) would cause a diastolic murmur, but may also present with exertional dyspnea from congestive heart failure (but not syncope or angina). Mitral valve regurgitation (C) also can manifest as heart failure, but there would again be no syncope or angina. The murmur of mitral regurgitation is holosystolic at the apex (remember the only two other causes of holosystolic murmurs is tricuspid regurgitation or a ventricular sepetal defect). Isolated mitral valve prolapse (E) causes a mid-systolic click, but no murmur unless mitral regurgitation is also present.

The sarcomere of striated muscle is the basic unit of skeletal muscle, which is composed of the following: A band, Z line/disc, M line, I band, and H zone. The A band (anisotropic band) is the area that contains the thick filament regardless of the overlapping area with the thin filament, and thus does not shorten with muscle contraction. The segment between two Z lines/discs comprise the sarcomere. On both sides of the Z lines/discs is the area called the I band (isotropic band), which is composed of the thin actin filaments that are not overlapping with the myosin thick filaments. The H zone is the area of the A band that does not overlap with the thin actin filaments. The M line is within the H zone, lies in the middle of the sarcomere, and contains the connecting proteins that hold the thick myofilaments together. Berg et al. describe the muscle contraction that occurs via the hydrolysis of ATP, which powers the movement of the myosin head along the thin actin filament. The movement is regulated by the tropomyosin/troponin complex, which sits on top of the myosin binding sites on actin thereby blocking myosin from binding. When the muscle cell is depolarized and there is a transient increase in intracellular calcium, the tropomyosin/troponin complex detects this increase and allows myosin to interact with the binding site on the actin filament, allowing the sarcomere to contract. Berg et al. further describe the hydrolysis of ATP to drive the power stroke of the myosin head. When ADP is bound to the myosin head, it is attached to actin. When myosin releases ADP and binds to another molecule of ATP it releases from the actin filament. This ATP binding causes a conformational change that allows the myosin to move up the actin filament. As ATP is hydrolyzed, it rebinds to the actin filament; the release of the hydrolyzed phosphate group increases the affinity for the myosin head to the actin filament and leads to a conformational change that produces the power stroke. Now the myosin is bound to the ADP and the cycle can repeat itself.', 1),

It is caused by a defect in CD18, the leukocyte integrin. This integrin is involved in chemotaxis and adhesion of leukocytes. The leukocytosis is due to failed margination. LAD type 2 is a due to a deficiency in CD15s, the receptor of endothelial selectins. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane adhesive proteins. An integrin heterodimer consists of one Î±-subunit and one Î²-subunit, each of which exist in several different subtypes. Ligand specificities are determined by different combinations of Î±- and Î²-subunits. Integrins are important for intercellular adhesion as well as cellular adhesion to ECM components.', 1),

Jejunal villi are long flat structures covered by a simple columnar epithelium consisting of many tall, thin, columnar absorptive cells with an apical microvillous brush border. These cells are primarily responsible for absorption of digested nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine. In addition, the jejunal mucosal epithelium has goblet cells interspersed between columnar absorptive cells.

The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus. It consists of two membranes that are continuous with one another at the numerous nuclear pores. The outer membrane of the nuclear envelope is continuous with the RER. It has ribosomes bound to its outer (facing the cytoplasm) surface. The principal material within the nucleus is the chromatin, a complex made up of DNA and a variety of nuclear proteins that function to define the packaging of the DNA and determine what portions (and when) are accessible to the processes of DNA duplication, repair, and/or transcription into RNA. When chromatin is condensed and unavailable to such processes it is referred to as heterochromatin; the highly condensed chromosomes that take part in mitosis are the most extreme example of heterochromatinization. In contrast, euchromatin is the term used to describe chromatin found in the relatively decondensed configuration that allows access of the various proteins required, e.g., for transcription into mRNA. The most obvious organelle within the nucleus is the nucleolus, consisting of specific portions of chromatin that contain the DNA sequences that code for the major ribosomal RNAs. The nucleolus is the site of rRNA synthesis and processing, as well as the site at which ribosomal proteinsâ€”made in the cytoplasm and transported into the nucleus via the nuclear envelope poresâ€”are assembled, along with the rRNAs, into the large and small ribosomal subunits.', 1),
